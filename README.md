# **The Purpose of Smart Contracts**

## **The Essence of Blockchain and Smart Contracts**

### **Contracts and Agreements in Everyday Life**
Most interactions or transactions involve **agreements** or **contracts**. Here are a few relatable examples:

- ðŸª‘ **Buying a Chair**: Contracts exist for materials, assembly, and the sale process.  
- âš¡ **Electricity Supply**: A contract governs the relationship between a consumer and the electric company.  
- ðŸš— **Car Services**: Agreements are made when paying for services like oil changes.  

However, traditional contracts **rely on trust** between parties, which can sometimes lead to issues around **honesty and fairness**.

## **The Problem with Traditional Agreements**

### **1. Consumer Trust Issues**  
- **Example**: *McDonaldâ€™s Monopoly Game* in the **1980s and 1990s** was rigged by insiders, breaking consumer trust.  
   - **Solution**: If the Monopoly game had used **blockchain and smart contracts**, fraud would have been impossible due to decentralization, immutability, and transparency.

---

### **2. Banking and Trust**  
- **Example**: Traditional banks have historically failed to protect peopleâ€™s money, such as during the **Great Depression**.  
   - **Solution**: **Blockchain** and **smart contracts** provide transparency and automated solvency checks which prevent **bank insolvency**.

---

### **3. Financial Markets Access**  
- **Example**: In **2021**, Robinhood restricted access to trading certain stocks.  
   - **Solution**: **Decentralized exchanges** like [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org) ensure fairness and openness without interference from central authorities.

## **Summary: Traditional Agreements vs. Smart Contracts**

| **Traditional Agreements**         | **Smart Contracts**                       |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Require trust in centralized entities. | Are **transparent**, **decentralized**, and **tamper-proof**. |
| Prone to manipulation and dishonesty.  | Guarantee honesty via code execution.     |
| Can lead to restricted access.        | Promote openness and inclusivity.         |

## **Benefits of Smart Contracts**

1. **Trust Minimization**:  
   - Smart contracts reduce reliance on trust-based systems that have historically failed.

2. **Unbreakable Promises**:  
   - Represent promises as **code on the blockchain** which ensure public visibility and **automatic execution**.

3. **Security and Speed**:  
   - Smart contracts provide robust security, **uptime advantages**, and rapid execution.

## **Caution: Not All Platforms Are Equal**

- **Example**: *FTX Collapse (2022)*  
   - FTX claimed to be decentralized but operated as a **Web2 company** which deceived users.  

### **Key Takeaway**:  
**Distinguish** between **legitimate decentralized projects** and platforms falsely claiming to represent **Web3**.

## **Conclusion**

### **Adoption and Transformation**  
Smart contracts and blockchain are **transforming markets** by ensuring **honesty**, **transparency**, and **fairness**. More industries are rapidly adopting these technologies for their numerous benefits.

### **Discernment and Value Creation**  
As a developer, user, or enthusiast:  
- Focus on contributing to the **Web3 space**.  
- Build and engage with platforms that create **real value**.  
- Avoid platforms that mislead or exploit blockchain technology.
